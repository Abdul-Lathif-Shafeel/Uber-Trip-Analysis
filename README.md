Tools Used:


MS EXCEL: collecting data and importing it into Power BI.

POWER BI: Visualizing data with useful charts to gain insights.

POWER QUERY: Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool that enables users to import, transform, and manipulate data from various sources within Excel and Power BI. It simplifies and automates the process of cleaning, reshaping, and merging data, making it easier to prepare data for analysis or reporting purposes. With Power Query, users can perform tasks such as removing duplicates, splitting columns, merging tables, and aggregating data, all within a user-friendly interface, without the need for complex formulas or coding.

DAX: It’s designed to perform calculations, create custom measures, and manipulate data within these platforms, enabling users to derive insights and make data-driven decisions efficiently.
